Categorize the news article into one of the 2 categories:\\n\\nTrue\\n\\n\\n [/INST][INPUT] ###Input:washington      donald j  trump  exuding confidence after his resounding primary victories in the east  promised a foreign policy on wednesday that he said would put  america first    he castigated president obama and hillary clinton  a former secretary of state and a possible opponent in the general election  for what he described as a string of missteps that have disillusioned the nation s allies and emboldened its rivals  mr  trump  the   for the republican presidential nomination  pledged a major buildup of the military  the swift destruction of the islamic state and the rejection of trade deals that he said tied the nation s hands  but he also pointedly rejected the   of the george w  bush administration  reminding his audience that he had opposed the iraq war   america is going to be strong again america is going to be great again it s going to be a friend again   mr  trump said   we re going to finally have a coherent foreign policy  based on american interests and the shared interests of our allies     the world must know that we do not go abroad in search of enemies  that we are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies   he added   that s what we want  we want to bring peace to the world    for mr  trump  whose campaign appearances are often a gleeful exercise in showmanship and    wisecracks  the speech had all the trappings of a serious address  standing beneath a twinkling chandelier in a washington hotel ballroom  backed by american flags and facing a sedate  largely   audience  a measured mr  trump read his remarks from a teleprompter  staying almost completely on script  but if mr  trump adopted establishment trappings  his speech still had an insurgent tone  he criticized allies in europe and asia for not bearing the burden of their own defense  he said he would try to mend fences with russia  and he assailed his opponents for being overly aggressive in foreign affairs  mr  trump said he had no plans to take advice from the foreign policy elite  and his agenda reflected that      a mélange of ideas that defied republican and democratic orthodoxy  there were paradoxes throughout mr  trump s speech  he called for a return to the coherence of america s foreign policy during the cold war  yet he was openly suspicious of the institutions that undergirded that era  he promised to eradicate the islamic state  but said the campaign against extremism      or as he called it   radical islam       was as much a philosophical struggle as a military one   our friends and enemies must know that if i draw a line in the sand  i will enforce that line in the sand      believe me   mr  trump said   however  unlike other candidates for the presidency  foreign aggression will not be my first instinct    he did not mention anyone by name  though his strongest republican opponent  senator ted cruz of texas  has threatened to   the islamic state until the desert sand glows  mr  trump s speech drew negative reaction across the political spectrum  senator lindsey graham  republican of south carolina  posted on twitter that  ronald reagan must be rolling over in his grave    lanhee chen  a fellow at the hoover institution who advised mitt romney  the  republican nominee  said  there was clearly an isolationist strain to the speech  but that runs into the reality of the world that we live in    r  nicholas burns  a former senior state department official under mr  bush who now advises mrs  clinton  said   he s casting these thunderbolts and threats at our allies  and yet there was almost a   treatment of russia and china    even mr  trump s embrace of the slogan  america first  raised eyebrows  with critics noting that it was popularized in the  by the aviator charles a  lindbergh and other isolationists who opposed the united states  entering world war ii   to fly the banner of america first shows that he has historical amnesia or just doesn t understand history   mr  burns said  in one of his few concrete proposals  mr  trump said he would convene summit meetings in europe and asia to overhaul nato and rebalance nuclear security arrangements with japan and south korea  he did not repeat a statement he made to the new york times that those countries should consider acquiring their own nuclear weapons  mr  trump was scathing about the obama administration s intervention in libya  lashing mrs  clinton to the policy  which he said had left a security vacuum filled by the islamic state  he also faulted mr  obama for his failure to enforce the red line he laid down in syria  yet mr  trump made clear he would use military force only as a last resort   we re getting out of the   business and instead focusing on creating stability on the world   mr  trump said  on pressing issues like counterterrorism  mr  trump broke little new ground  he declined  for example  to give any details on how he planned to destroy the islamic state to avoid tipping the military s hand  beyond vowing that  they will be gone quickly    mr  trump repeated his desire to seek improved relations with russia and its president  vladimir v  putin      a strategy that carried echoes of mr  obama s attempt to  reset  relations with russia after its invasion of georgia in   but he said his skills as a deal maker would make him more successful at it   i see improved relations with russia  from a position of strength  as possible   mr  trump said   some say the russians won t be reasonable i intend to find out    in another echo of mr  obama  mr  trump said he would seek advice from outside the foreign policy establishment  he said he would choose  the best minds  with practical solutions  rather than people with  perfect résumés  and records of failure around the world  he did not mention any names  mr  trump promised to make the united states more dependable in the eye of its friends and allies  and more respected by its enemies  yet just moments earlier  he also advocated increased unpredictability   we have to be unpredictable   he said   and we have to be unpredictable starting now    the relatively small    crowd consisted of journalists  seated in the back  and seven rows of guests      a largely    crowd that included senator jeff sessions of alabama  a senior policy adviser to the campaign a handful of house members and grover norquist  the president of americans for tax reform  mr  trump recently overhauled his campaign team  bringing in new advisers who have begun to impose discipline and organization to what was often a chaotic campaign  the candidate himself has taken steps toward  more presidential  behavior  as he calls it  mr  trump  who delights in mocking scripted candidates who use teleprompters  delivered his speech with the help of two teleprompters  and aides said he had practiced with them over the weekend  the new york billionaire worked on his foreign policy speech for more than a week  according to an aide  with the help of some advisers his campaign would not identify   the speech is his words and his thoughts   said paul manafort  mr  trump s newly installed campaign chief  mr  trump was introduced by zalmay khalilzad  an   diplomat who was mr  bush s ambassador to afghanistan and iraq  and is closely identified with the american wars in those countries  mr  khalilzad said afterward that he was not advising mr  trump formally or informally  and that the two men met for the first time in a holding room adjacent to where he delivered his speech  [/INPUT] ###Response:True
